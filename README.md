# javascript-ray-casting

**javascript-ray-casting** is a [Ray Casting] engine built using [p5.js] to render all the graphics. It attempts to simulate a pseudo 3D environment from a 2D map

This technique was very popular in game development in the 90s, when computer could not simulate a fully 3D environment in real time. Ray casting can go very fast, because only a calculation has to be done for every vertical line of the screen. Some of the most well known games that used this technique, are of course [Wolfenstein 3D] and [DOOM].
